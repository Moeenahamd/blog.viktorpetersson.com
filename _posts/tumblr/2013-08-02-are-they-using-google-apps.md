In the past few months, I’ve started moved most of my conference calls from Skype to Google Hangout. The video and audio quality is a lot better, and it’s more convenient to manage. There is however one problem: If the other party isn’t using Google Apps or Gmail, they cannot join the Hangout. This has delayed many conferences calls for me.

To resolve this issue, I wrote a simple web app called [Are They Using Google Apps?](http://aretheyusinggoogleapps.com/). You can enter either the domain, or the email address, and the tool will tell you if the other party is using Google Apps (by simply checking the MX records).

If they are using Google Apps, I will schedule a Google Hangout, and if not, I will schedule the conference call with [UberConference](http://www.uberconference.com/).
